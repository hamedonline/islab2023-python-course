# ISLab Python Course

Welcome to github repository of ISLab Python Course. The 2023 cohort of Python course starts on 2nd of August and is planned to be completed in 10 sessions.

Sessions are held via Skype platform and we'll make sure to get them recorded. Hence, all registered participants will have access to video files. Students of this course also get added to a dedicated private Telegram group, giving them the option to ask questions, join discussions, share progress and seek guidance from mentors regarding any problems they may encounter during the course.

All the teaching materials including presentation slides, jupyter notebook codes that contain code snippets ran through each session, exercises, etc., will be uploaded gradually on this repository, as the course goes on. Make sure to notice possible fixes or updates in future to stay in sync with the latest version of files.

## Special Session: A Brief Introduction to Machine Learning

[[Slides]](./special-session_intro-to-machine-learning/ss_slides.pdf) [[Jupyter Notebook]](./special-session_intro-to-machine-learning/ss_MLP-from-scratch.ipynb)

During the course, an additional session was held to provide students with a brief introduction to fundamental machine learning concepts. The session covered a range of topics, including general machine learning principles, the differences between machine learning and traditional programming, data types, data splitting, data pre-processing, data leakage, and various types of machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The session concluded with a coding demonstration that walked students through the process of developing a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) from scratch.
