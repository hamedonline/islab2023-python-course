# ISLab Python Course

Welcome to github repository of ISLab Python Course. The 2023 cohort of Python course starts on 2nd of August and is planned to be completed in 10 sessions.

Sessions are held via Skype platform and we'll make sure to get them recorded. Hence, all registered participants will have access to video files. Students of this course also get added to a dedicated private Telegram group, giving them the option to ask questions, join discussions, share progress and seek guidance from mentors regarding any problems they may encounter during the course.

All the teaching materials including presentation slides, jupyter notebook codes that contain code snippets ran through each session, exercises, etc., will be uploaded gradually on this repository as the course goes on. Make sure to notice possible fixes or updates in future to stay in sync with the latest version of files.
