    "## Approach 2: Using Anaconda (or its minimal variants)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is based on utilizing Conda to manage virtual Python environments. [\"Anaconda\"](https://anaconda.com) is a complete environment & package management tool that makes it super easy for data science lovers to get most of the needed libraries installed. Conda also manages package dependencies way better than `pip` when it comes to handling large bunch of them in a virtual environment. It is is actually very straight-forward to setup the whole tools via provided installers on Anaconda website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Anaconda is preferred by many to get Python installed along side with popular libraries. However, the main installer contains numerous libraries that you may not need at the beginning of your journey. [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) as well as [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), are two very good alternative minimal installers for Conda that include only conda package manager, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful libraries. In spite of all these advantages, Conda's official release channel for packages is infamous for being behind in terms of updates. Conda-forge on the other hand, is a community-led release channel that provides up-to-date packages in Anaconda ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We prefer Miniforge for the following reasons:\n",
    "- It is minimal with no un-needed libraries installed (just like Miniconda)\n",
    "- It comes with Conda-forge as the main channel for the packages (up-to-date package releases guaranteed)\n",
    "- On the plus side, it is also supported on more CPU & hardware configs\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that `pip` is available in all variations of Conda ecosystem and if for some reason you can't find your required library in conda channels, you always have `pip` at your fingertips."

    "Miniforge is available to download from GitHub repository located [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge). Depending on your OS, choose the appropriate installer and go ahead with finishing the wizard. It is advisable to run your installer with admin privileges if you want to make Conda available for all users on the system. If you're on a Windows machine, you'd also better do the installation on a root path (e.g., C:\\miniforge), since some packages might run into problems in case of spaces on their path.\n",
